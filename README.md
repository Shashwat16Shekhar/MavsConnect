# MavsConnect
Building connections and adjusting to a new environment can 1 be difficult. Such as finding a new home and settling into a new neighbourhood, creating new routines, and
making new social ties are all examples of transitions. The "MAVS CONNECT" App can solve and answer all these questions.
Text messaging is one of the most popular and efficient ways to communicate with people in the world. Most individuals prefer texting these days for communication. Online
communication allows users to communicate with other people in a fast and convenient way. With all this, as the application name suggests, it's an app that allows UTA students to
communicate with other UTA students. Through online contact, it will enable you to get in touch and learn more about one another. New incoming students can take help from seniors
and learn more about the university. Moreover, it will simplify for students to find accommodation that suits their needs and comfort. As they can post in the group chat,
anyone who is interested can get in touch with that student.
